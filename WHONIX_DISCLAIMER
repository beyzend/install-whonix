This is not the usual blah blah blah but fact. Whonix is a research project.
Whonix is free of charge. Whonix is a
derivative of Debian GNU/Linux. Whonix is produced independently of, with no
guarantee from, The Tor Project. Whonix is created by volunteers in their spare
time. Whonix was created by self-taught hobbyists in their spare time, without
the backing of any particular formal certification or training. Although Whonix
attempts to be as usable as possible, there are many ways in which it fails.
Whonix is in English. Do not use Whonix without excellent knowledge of the
English language. Misunderstandings have consequences. Whonix is based on other
software, including GNU/Linux, Debian, and virtualization. Do not rely on
Whonix without working knowledge of these technologies.

The documentation available on Whonix.org is a crash course in anonymity,
privacy, and security on the Internet. Whonix is a technological means to
anonymity, but staying anonymous is not just a technological problem: No tool
is enough to keep you safe. Anonymity is a complex problem without an easy
solution, and security is only as strong as its weakest link, often the user.
The more you know, the safer you can be.
